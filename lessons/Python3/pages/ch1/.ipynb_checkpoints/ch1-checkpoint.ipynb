    "## Introduction\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is for you to learn how to think like a computer scientist. Programming really is a means to an end, and a way for us to apply our problem solving skills. First, we'll learn about what exactly a program is, their components, and how everything comes together.\n",

    "## 1.1 What is a program?\n",
    "Programs are a series of instructions, that explicitely defines the behavior of a machine by executing commands and computations. There are tons of different instructions you can give a machine to execute, but (for the most part) all languages have some very important types of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**input: ** Gets information from forms of input, such as files, keyboards, the network, or any other sort of input device.\n",
    "\n",
    "**output: ** Returns data to the user by displaying it on the screen, saving it in a file/device, sending it back over a network, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**math: ** Basic mathematical operations. More complicated math (such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, etc.) can be found elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "**conditionals: ** Checking for \"conditions\", and running specific code as a result of these conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**loops/repetition: ** Repeating an action, generally with some variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs can basically be deconstructed into a combination of these types of commands linking together other general instructions. It is helpful to think of programming as the process of breaking problems into smaller and smaller subtasks.\n",

    "To Python on its own, you can run the Python **interpreter**. What this does is read in Python code, and executes it on the fly. You can execute it by typing `python` for Python2, or `python3` for Python3. We'll be using Python3 for this tutorial. When you execute the command, you should see some output similar to this:\n",

    "\n",
    "On the fourth line, we see `>>>`, which is what's known as the **prompt**. The prompt is the interpreters way to indicate that it is ready for you to enter code - until you see it, expect it to be unresponsive to whatever you do. As a note, if you're ever running code and want to abort an operation, enter `Ctrl c`, which will interrupt the operations and exit out of the last call made.\n",
